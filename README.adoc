= FatFSDriver Library for Arduino =

This library serves as an Arduino wrapper library for Chan's FatFs and uses a generic SPI implementation to communicate with an SD Card
FatFs is a generic FAT/exFAT filesystem module for small embedded systems.
The FatFs module is written in compliance with ANSI C (C89) and completely separated from the disk I/O layer.
Therefore it is independent of the platform.
